The definition of e-learning 

Also known as “online training” or “distance learning”, e-learning is a digital form of learning. It appeared in the early noughties, when internet penetration rates began to rise dramatically. As the name suggests, e-learning takes place remotely and online via information and communication technologies (such as computers, smartphones and tablets).

An e-learning training programme is composed of several learning modules and is intended for an individual learner or group of learners. The modules themselves are broken down into stages, with a mix of different formats (text, video, audio, quizzes, etc.).


The definition of blended learning 

When training professionals first became aware that e-learning wasn’t producing the desired results, they decided to come up with new ways of delivering training. This is how blended learning (also known as hybrid learning) was born.

Blended learning combines the best of in-person and digital learning in the same training programme. It can involve a combination of e-learning modules, virtual classes, in-person training, collaborative exercises via web chats or forums, and so on.
